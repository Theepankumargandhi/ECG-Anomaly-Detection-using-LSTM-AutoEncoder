# ECG-Anomaly-Detection-using-LSTM-AutoEncoder
Built an LSTM AutoEncoder to detect anomalies in ECG time series data with 97.93% accuracy. Trained on normal signals, the model uses reconstruction error to identify anomalies. Implemented with TensorFlow and visualized predictions for interpretable results.
